# PyBook
This is a collection of Python tricks that I found interesting while working on several python projects. This repository is meant to be used as a quick reference for myself and others. If you are visiting and can suggest an improvement to any of the methods used, please do.

# Goal
This repository is started to be more of a documentation rather than a collection. In future, I hope to convert this into a real documentation.
